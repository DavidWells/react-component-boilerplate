## React Component Boilerplate

React-Component-Boilerplate lets you test and create React components quickly with Karma. Have your tests run continuously with the added benefit of testing in your favorite and least favorite browsers while also having access to developer tools. Win Win. This was born out of the following [thread](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/116). 

### Setup

* Clone the repo
* Run `npm install`

### Building Your Component

* Run `npm start`
* Open `index.html` and view your awesome creation

### Testing Your Component

* To have your  tests run continuously, just run `./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start karma.conf.js --no-single-run` or you can always change the Karma configuration file
